    Making sense of the world The world is a complex and evolving place; but often
    that is available to young African audiences fails to explain why and how
    things affect their daily life. We at Debunk Media want to change that. And
    so, we've brought together journalists, data scientists, filmmakers,
    illustrators and animators to try and make sense of the world through the art
    of storytellingâ€¦Oh btw; there's even a doctor on the team. Debunk Media was
    launched in July 2020.
